Capstone Project for CSC 522 - Automated Learning and Data Analysis

With the increased use of social media, we have seen that sharing information has never been easier. With this said, sharing incorrect information and making it viral has also become very easy which iscausing a lot of problems as this can be used as a powerful influencing tool. In this project we focuson classifying news articles as Fact or Fake by analyzing the text of the article, its headline and theURL of its source. After some research and exploratory analysis, we compiled a set of features bysummarizing the text of the article, finding its sentiment and checking authenticity of the source ofthe article, which prove to be useful features for the classification process. In addition, we created models using various classification algorithms and tuned them for automatic detection of fake news articles.
